# Chisel Examples

The shall be a collection of code examples for [Chisel](https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/).

This collection will be moved to the latest version of Chisel, Chisel 3.
I will collect notes in [TowardsChisel3](TowardsChisel3.md)

The blinking LED (in hello-world) has been ported to Chisel 3.
The other examples are still in Chisel 2.

# Getting the Examples

    $ git clone https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples.git

The collection is organized as follows:

**hello-world** is a fully self contained minimal project for a blinking LED in an FPGA.

**examples** is a collection of small Chisel projects.


# Needed Tools

 * A recent version of Java

 * The Scala build tool [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)
