# Towards Chisel 3

I will take notes along the way when moving this example collection
to Chisel 3.

See also [Chisel2 vs. Chisel3](https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel3/wiki/Chisel3-vs-Chisel2).

Not all steps will be needed for all projects. And maybe your project is
more advanced and needs additional steps.

## Preparation Work

 * Move to the latest version of Chisel2 (2.2.38) and check that everything works as expected
 * Fork Chisel2 and have the source of the latest version in Eclipse (but did not really work, so delayed this exercise until Chisel 3)
 * Start to use some actual features, such as nicer constant syntax
