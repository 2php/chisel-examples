This is a minimum build environment to start with Chisel.

The Chisel tutorial provides a framework with exercises and a lot
of automation to get started with Chisel examples. However, this
automation makes it hard to see how the individual pieces fit together.
Therefore, this is a try to cut it down to the minimum.

The example project consists of:

   src/Hello.scala     The source of a hardware description of a blinking LED
   Makefile            drives the build process
   build.sbt           Configuration to download Chisel and for the Chisel project
   sbt/sbt-launch.jar  is the SBT build tool for Scala
   verilog/hello_top.v is a top level file for the FPGA
   quartus/altde0      contains the Altera Quartus project files for the DE0 board
   quartus/bemicro     contains the Altera Quartus project files for the BeMicro board

The actual project configuration (files, folders, main entry,...) is
distributed in build.sbt and as parameters to Chisel in the Makefile.

Remarks and comments are distributed over the individual files.

HOWTO:

1.) make
2.) Open the project file in Quartus
2.a.) Compile with the play button
2.b.) Configure the FPGA with the programmer
